[font=Verdana][size=5]Introduction[/size]

[url=https://github.com/Yagisan/The-Bustling-Valley]The Bustling Valley [/url]is a curated modlist designed for a bigger Stardew Valley experience. Designed for experienced players, it comes with 2 huge expansions (Stardew Valley Expanded, and Ridgeside Village), and several smaller expansions including new NPCS. With an enormous variety of new crops, new artisan goods, and new recipes, you'll find something new to specialise your farm in. [b]It is expected that players will not add additional mods or otherwise change this modlist.[/b]

Please be aware that this modlist may make perfection very hard or impossible to get.
