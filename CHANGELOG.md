## Semantic Versioning

This modlist uses semantic versioning, where given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible mod list changes. **a new game is required**
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, **a new game is recommended**
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

**Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time.** Read more about [Semantic Versioning here](https://semver.org/).
